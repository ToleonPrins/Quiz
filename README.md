# Short Description
SwiftUI Quiz App

This is a quiz application developed using the SwiftUI framework and Firebase. Users can participate in the quiz by answering multiple-choice questions and testing their knowledge. The project includes the following features:

- User Interface: The app features a modern design built with SwiftUI. The graphical interface includes animations and a variety of design elements.

- Firebase Integration: To store information about questions and answers, as well as to track participant statistics, the project utilizes Firebase Cloud Firestore. Users can participate in the quiz anonymously, and results are stored in the cloud.

- Dynamic Questions: Quiz questions are stored in the Firebase database, and the app automatically fetches them for users. Questions have multiple answer options, and users can select their choice and receive immediate feedback.

- User Experience: The user interface is designed for aesthetics and usability. Users can view quiz rules, see statistics, and initiate the quiz experience.

- Result Tracking: After completing the quiz, users are presented with their score as a percentage of correct answers. The score is saved, and users can retake the quiz to improve their performance.

The project is created as a showcase of SwiftUI's capabilities in developing user interfaces and Firebase integration for data storage and exchange. This application can also serve as a foundation for further enhancements and modifications.
